# About the Project

Being a forex trader and global economics admirer, I created a simple Python program with the help of an API (API-Ninjas) to provide real-time exchange rates for a broad range of international currencies. To improve the user interface, I added a plain graphical user interface through Python's built-in library of Tkinter.
